If Canada's GHG emissions per year were shared equally per each person in Canada, each person would emit 19.6 t CO2 eq per year – which is just over 3 times the global rate.Transportation is one of the largest sources of carbon pollution in Canada. Automobiles and light trucks account for about 11 per cent of Canada’s total greenhouse gas emissions.


This project is used to find the co2 emission that is produced by the different types of vehicles.
